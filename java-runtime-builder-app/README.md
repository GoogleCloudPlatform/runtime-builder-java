# Java Runtime Builder App

This module contains the core logic for the Java Runtime Builder.

## Issues (these should be moved to github issues once available):
 - add checkstyle check for license file
 - thoughtful progress logging 
 - add support for deploying slim jar (and war also?) that references local paths to other jar dependencies
