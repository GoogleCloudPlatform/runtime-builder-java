# Java Runtime Builder App

This module contains the core logic for the Java Runtime Builder.

## Issues (these should be moved to github issues once available):
 - javadoc on public methods
 - add checkstyle and other static analysis
 - thoughtful progress logging 
 - implement the gradle invoker
 - add support for mvn/gradle wrappers
 - add support for deploying slim jar (and war also?) that references local paths to other jar dependencies
